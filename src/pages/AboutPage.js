         <p> Try paced (or responsive, or cue-based) feeding, which mimics breastfeeding. 
             Use a slow-flow nipple, keep the bottle horizontal, pause frequently during feedings,
              switch sides as you would when breastfeeding, and stop feeding your baby when he
               shows signs of
               being full. 
             Let someone else feed him the first bottle.</p>
